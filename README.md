In this project I will demonstrate the skills that I have learned in my Data Analyst Certification Course. I will use these skills to solve the business problem of Athee Motors a pseudo car dealer based in San Francisco. Following the data analysis process of Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act to help them to make data-driven decisions
About the Company:
In 1991, Sandy started a small car dealership store in heart of San Franciso with only two cars in store. And now three decades later Athee motors is one of biggest and most popular car dealer with cars from Nissan Versa S to Bugatti la Voiture Noire.
To stay at top in this cutting-edge competitive car dealership business Atlee motors wants to know their strong fronts and improve areas in which they are lagging for this they want insights and suggestions backed by data.
Ask
Objective:
The objective of this project is to design and develop a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Tableau. The dashboard will visualize critical KPIs related to their car sales, helping them understand their sales performance over time and make data-driven decisions.
Problem Statement:
The dashboard should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to our sales data. This will enable us to make informed decisions, monitor our progress, and identify trends and opportunities for growth.
1.	Sales Overview:
•	Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales
•	Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales
2.	Average Price Analysis:
•	YTD Average Price
•	YOY Growth in Average Price
3.	Cars Sold Metrics:
•	YTD Cars Sold
•	YOY Growth in Cars Sold

Stakeholders:
Sanvi Singh: Director of Sales and Marketing. Sanvi is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the car sales
Athee marketing analytics team: A team of data analyst who are responsible for collecting, analyzing and reporting data to create Athee’s marketing strategy
Athee executive team: Detail oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program 
Prepare:
The first step in my prepare process is to download data that I will need for my analysis. We will be using first party data of pseudo company “Athee Motors” as car sales data which is downloaded from Data Tutorials website in the excel format. It contains total of two sheets
Process:
Data Cleaning:
Excel
To begin the data cleaning process, I opened excel file and did the following things
•	Checked for and removed any duplicates
•	Used the trim () function to remove unwanted spaces
•	Changed the data type of date field to make it tableau compatible
•	Corrected the formatting of data it make it look better
•	Checked each field for spelling mistake and typo errors and corrected it
Note: A copy of raw data was kept separate for backup



Analyze:
I started the analysis with Exploratory Data Analysis to find trends in Athee’s Sales. First, I performed Univariate Analysis on each field to understand data deeply and then performed Multivariate Analysis to see relation between it.
Here are the key insights from the data:
•	Majority of customers are male (79%)
•	There was lots of fluctuation in sales over the month with a periodic trend of huge drop in sales immediate after the month with good sales. A detailed analysis will be required to diagnose root cause behind this trend
•	SUV, Hatchback and Sedan are top 3 most sold car types
•	Chevrolet, Dodge and Ford are the most preferred brands among customers
•	 79% of customers take home their dream car in either Pale White or Black
•	Customers where not picky for Engine or Transmission type
•	Thomas, Emma and Lucas were the most loyal and bulk buyers, buying more than 80 cars in the given time period 
•	Austin, Janesville, Scottdale were top 3 sales region

Share:
The dashboard I created can be found on Tableau  click here to see dashboard
To keep my dashboard visually appealing and easy to digest I had placed only most important KPI’s and business metrics which include:
•	YTD Total Sales (Total revenue earned in latest or current year)
•	YTD Total Car Sold (Total number of cars sold in current year)
•	YTD Average Price (Revenue generated per car)
•	Weekly sales of cars
•	Brand wise sales trends
•	Total sales based on color of car
•	Region wise sales

Act:
To remain at top position in business Athee Motors should increase number of new buyers and retain previous customers
1.	Good bonus and commission policy should be made for months after good sales months to reduce fall in sales  
2.	Since majority of customers are male, company should make advertisement appealing to men and target men gathering places for bill boards such as clubs, petrol pumps a.k.a gas station of Austin, Janesville and Scottdale region
3.	To increase female buyers marketing campaign can be run to link owning a car with gender equality and feminism to influence them to buy a car 
4.	Athee motors should give exciting offers on pale white or black SUV, Hacthback and Sedan of Chevrolet, Dodge and Ford
